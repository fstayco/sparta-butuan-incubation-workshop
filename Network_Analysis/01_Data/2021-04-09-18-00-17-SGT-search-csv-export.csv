INAPRUBAHAN na sa ikatlo at huling pagbasa ang panukalang batas na ibilang na special non-working holiday ang anibersaryo ng Iglesia ni Cristo (INC).

Batay sa House Bill 5686, tuwing anibersaryo ng Iglesia Ni Cristo na July 27 ay idedeklara itong non-working holiday.

Ang pagpapasa sa panukala ay isinagawa kaalinsabay ng ika-103 taong anibersaryo ng INC na inaprubahan ng may 242 kongresista.

Ang panukalang ito ay pinagsama-samang panukala nina Reps. Winston Castelo (PDP-Laban, Quezon City); Alfred Vargas (PDP-Laban, QC); Eugene de Vera (ABS Partylist); Gil P. Acosta (NP, Palawan); Gus Tambunting (PDP-Laban, Parañaque City) at Romeo Acop (LP, Antipolo City).

Sinabi ni Castelo na inaamyendahan ng HB 5686 ang Republic Act No. 9645 o mas kilala bilang Commemoration of the Founding Anniversary of Iglesia Ni Cristo Act, sa pamamagitan ng pagdedeklara ng July 27 bilang non-working holiday.

Paliwanag ni Castelo, chairman ng House Committee on Metro Manila Development, ito’y upang mabigyan ng pagkakataon ang mga Pilipino na miembro ng INC na maipagdiwang ang anibersaryo tuwing July 27.

Samantala, naipasa na sa Committee on Rules ang House Resolution 1163 na nagpapahatid ng pagbati sa ika-103 anibersaryo ng Iglesia Ni Cristo nitong nagdaang July 27, 2017 at ang House Resolution 1167 na nagpapahatid naman ng pagbati sa walong taong matagumpay na pangunguna ni Iglesia Ni Cristo Executive Minister Eduardo V. Manalo.

Hayaan niyo po sanang ilahad ko sa baba ang mga dahilan kung bakit kailangan nating magkaroon ng Single Maritime Administration sa ating bansa: 1. Sa kasalukuyan, ang Pilipinas lamang and bansa na walang isang Maritime Administration na nagpapalakad sa pagpatupad ng mga alituntunin ng IMO lalo na ang STCW. Sa Pilipinas, marami tayong ahensya na nangangasiwa para sa mga panga-ngailangan ng mga marino katulad ng CHED para sa Edukasyon ng Marino, PRC para sa pabibigay ng pagsusulit para ang isang Pilipino ay mabigyan ng lisensya, MARINA para mag issue ng Seaman’s Book at COP's, NTC para sa Radio Certificate at ilan pang ibang ahensya. 2. Nang dahil sa madaming ahensyang ito, napuna na ng EMSA na wala ngang iisang maritime administration para sa mga marino kaya’t sila ay nag-audit muli sa ating bansa noong nakaraang October. Ang EMSA audit na ito ay maaaring mag-dulot ng malaking kawalan sa atin dahil posibleng mawalan ng hanap-buhay ang mga 80,000 na Pilipinong kasalukuyang nakasakay sa mga European ships, kung sakaling mag desisyon ang EMSA na hindi sang-ayon sa STCW ang ating pamumuno dahil sa kawalan ng isang maritime administration . 3. Ang pagpuna ng EMSA sa kakulangang ito ay hindi na bago. Ito ay nagsimula pa ilang taon na rin ang nakalipas, kaya’t noong April 2012, si Presidente Noynoy Aquino ay gumawa ng paraan sa pamamagitan ng pag-issue ng EO 75. Ito ang pangunahang tugon n g ating gobyerno noong nakaraang taon, sa mga katanungan ng EMSA at ng ibang mga bansa kung sino ba talaga ang ahensya ng gobyerno ng Pilipinas na may pananagutan at resposibilidad sa pamamahala ng edukasyon, pagsusuri at pabibigay ng kaukulang dokumento sa isang Pilipinong Marino upang mag qualify at makapagtrabaho sa barko sa iba’t ibamg lugar sa mundo. 4. Para mapaigting ang layunin ng EO 75 at tuluyang maging batas, Single Maritime Administration Act ang kasagutan. 5. Marami ang nagtatanong kung ito ba ay nangangahulugang magtatayo ng panibagong ahensya kapag ang panakulang ito ay ganap na maging batas? Ang sagot po ay hindi. Ang layunin nito ay mag-talaga ng isang administration sa pamumuno at pangangalaga ng MARINA. Ang MARINA ay buo na at pag naipasa ang batas, sila lamang ay aatasang na gampanan ang karagdagang tungkulin na maipatupad ang nararapat na sistema ayon sa STCW. Ang pagbabaggo ay ang pagdaragdag ng ilang taong mahuhusay at eksperto sa ahensya ng MARINA na tutulong masakatuparan ang mga ito. Ang pagbubuklod ng lahat ng ahensya ay mangangahulugan na sa isang opisina na lang ang pupuntahan ng mga marino at ito ay matagal ng inaasam asam na ma isakatuparan. Kailangan nating unahin na magkaroon ng batas para hindi na maulit ang paibaibang patakaran para sa ating mga marino. Maaring marami ang nagdududa sa kakayanan ng MARINA subalit dapat natin silang bigyan ng pagkakataon at ating ding tulungan dahil ang lahat ng ito ay para sa ikabubuti ng ating industriya. Ang layunin ng Angkla at ng ating kinatawan na si Congressman Jess Manalo ay para maiwasan ang pagkalito at pagkabagal ng mga proseso sa pagkuha ng mga lisensya at sertipiko ng mga marinpong Pilipino, at higit sa lahat ang makasigurong ang ating mga proseso at standards ay naaayon sa STCW, na siyang tutulong upang tuluyan ng mawala ang banta ng EMSA at EU na hindi taggapin ang mga dokumento ng Pilipinong Marino para makapag trabaho sa mga barkong pag aari ng EU. Ang mga marino ay tunay na bagong bayani ng ating bansa na tumutulong para mapaunlad ang ating ekomiya. Kami ay humihingi ng inyong suporta at pagmamatyag para sama sama nating iaangat ang kalidad ng ahensya at makatugon sa mga alituntunin ng STCW. Ang tanging hangarin ng ANGKLA para sa mga marino ay masigurado ang tuloy tuloy na trabaho, mapadali ang proseso ng pagsasaayos ng dokumento at mapanatili ang pagiging numero uno sa buong mundo.

Ma. Lourdes Acosta-Alba held a roundtable discussion Tuesday, on “How to be a gender-responsive legislator."" The discussion aimed to address and eliminate discriminatory laws against women and girls, finetune legislative priorities, as well as identify gaps in the legal framework. The online discussion was organized by the committee, in partnership with the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW) and the International Development Law Organization (IDLO) to discuss the roadmap entitled, “Equality in Law for Women and Girls by 2030: A Multi-stakeholder Strategy for Accelerated Action.” The roadmap was launched by the UN Women in March 2019. IDLO Consultant Gettie Sandoval presented a study on the analysis of laws in the country from a gender perspective. She said there are women-specific laws consistent with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) but there are still inconsistencies and gaps in previous laws with the Magna Carta on Women. The research also revealed there are laws with prevailing gender stereotypes that need to be addressed. Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker Bernadette Herrera-Dy said the country maintains its post as the most gender-equal country in Asia, closing 80 percent of the labor force gap, as women outnumbered men in senior leadership roles as well as in the professional and technical fields. Herrera-Dy also encouraged stakeholders to put forward amendments on the antiquated laws that need change for a better, more gender-responsive and balanced legislation. Acosta-Alba urged legislators to continue building networks and alliances in crafting and passing important legislation. Acosta-Alba then announced that the committee would launch the handbook on ""How to be a Gender-Responsive Legislator"", which was developed by the PCW, once sessions resume in May. The handbook aims to guide legislators in taking a critical look at the lawmaking processes, as well as aiding them in refining proposed measures towards gender-responsiveness and promotion of women’s rights.

This year's theme is: ""Women Make Change Work for Women.” The ceremony was hosted by the Committee on Women and Gender Equality, chaired by Bukidnon Rep. Maria Lourdes Acosta-Alba. Acosta-Alba's inspirational message was delivered by Rep. Jocelyn Sy Limkaichong (1st District, Negros Oriental) on her behalf. Acosta-Alba urged that women must take on more leadership roles in society as she encouraged them to speak out boldly wherever they are. “We, women, should lead not only at the top levels of government, but also in communities and in our own homes. These are where a lot of decisions are made. It is through making decisions that we can effect positive change. We should never be afraid to speak out. Huwag tayong mananahimik. We have our own voices. We should never lose them,” she said. Acosta-Alba then urged her fellow lady leaders in communities and in the government to work together towards making a difference in the country by helping women, especially those who have gravely suffered due to the pandemic. “Despite all of the challenges we face, huwag tayong panghihinaan ng loob. We, women, are naturally strong and resilient. Kakayanin natin ang mga problemang ating haharapin. The first step is for us to know our worth. We are very capable. Hindi tayo babae lang. Babae tayo,” added Acosta-Alba. Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker Bernadette Herrera-Dy called for the commitment of the House Members and workforce to expedite the passage of measures that would bring about change and equality for the benefit of Filipinas. “Women are truly a force to be reckoned with. Women are strong and formidable yet loving and emphatic. Kaya mas lalong dapat ang Pilipina ay protektahan, bigyan ng dignidad, at bigyan ng kahalagahan sa sariling bansa,” Herrera-Dy said. All attendees were required to submit their Health Declaration Forms and negative Antigen test results. Wearing of face mask and face shields as well as practicing social distancing were also observed throughout the ceremony.

Batay sa House Bill 5686, tuwing anibersaryo ng Iglesia Ni Cristo na July 27 ay idedeklara itong non-working holiday.

Ang pagpapasa sa panukala ay isinagawa kaalinsabay ng ika-103 taong anibersaryo ng INC na inaprubahan ng may 242 kongresista.

Ang panukalang ito ay pinagsama-samang panukala nina Reps. Winston Castelo (PDP-Laban, Quezon City); Alfred Vargas (PDP-Laban, QC); Eugene de Vera (ABS Partylist); Gil P. Acosta (NP, Palawan); Gus Tambunting (PDP-Laban, Parañaque City) at Romeo Acop (LP, Antipolo City).

Sinabi ni Castelo na inaamyendahan ng HB 5686 ang Republic Act No. 9645 o mas kilala bilang Commemoration of the Founding Anniversary of Iglesia Ni Cristo Act, sa pamamagitan ng pagdedeklara ng July 27 bilang non-working holiday.

Paliwanag ni Castelo, chairman ng House Committee on Metro Manila Development, ito’y upang mabigyan ng pagkakataon ang mga Pilipino na miembro ng INC na maipagdiwang ang anibersaryo tuwing July 27.

Samantala, naipasa na sa Committee on Rules ang House Resolution 1163 na nagpapahatid ng pagbati sa ika-103 anibersaryo ng Iglesia Ni Cristo nitong nagdaang July 27, 2017 at ang House Resolution 1167 na nagpapahatid naman ng pagbati sa walong taong matagumpay na pangunguna ni Iglesia Ni Cristo Executive Minister Eduardo V.

INAPRUBAHAN na sa ikatlo at huling pagbasa ang panukalang batas na ibilang na special non-working holiday ang anibersaryo ng Iglesia ni Cristo (INC).

Batay sa House Bill 5686, tuwing anibersaryo ng Iglesia Ni Cristo na July 27 ay idedeklara itong non-working holiday.

Ang pagpapasa sa panukala ay isinagawa kaalinsabay ng ika-103 taong anibersaryo ng INC na inaprubahan ng may 242 kongresista.

Ang panukalang ito ay pinagsama-samang panukala nina Reps. Winston Castelo (PDP-Laban, Quezon City); Alfred Vargas (PDP-Laban, QC); Eugene de Vera (ABS Partylist); Gil P. Acosta (NP, Palawan); Gus Tambunting (PDP-Laban, Parañaque City) at Romeo Acop (LP, Antipolo City).

Sinabi ni Castelo na inaamyendahan ng HB 5686 ang Republic Act No. 9645 o mas kilala bilang Commemoration of the Founding Anniversary of Iglesia Ni Cristo Act, sa pamamagitan ng pagdedeklara ng July 27 bilang non-working holiday.

Paliwanag ni Castelo, chairman ng House Committee on Metro Manila Development, ito’y upang mabigyan ng pagkakataon ang mga Pilipino na miembro ng INC na maipagdiwang ang anibersaryo tuwing July 27.

Samantala, naipasa na sa Committee on Rules ang House Resolution 1163 na nagpapahatid ng pagbati sa ika-103 anibersaryo ng Iglesia Ni Cristo nitong nagdaang July 27, 2017 at ang House Resolution 1167 na nagpapahatid naman ng pagbati sa walong taong matagumpay na pangunguna ni Iglesia Ni Cristo Executive Minister Eduardo V. Manalo.

She stressed the importance of people’s participation in the COVID-19 vaccination program. “Dahil ang people’s participation ay naguugnay sa lahat ng klase ng tao, mayaman man o mahirap, at higit sa lahat, ang civil society o ang nasa gobyerno,” she said.

INC ANNIVERSARY bilang NON-WORKING HOLIDAY, PASADO sa KAMARA 😊

INAPRUBAHAN na sa ikatlo at huling pagbasa ang panukalang batas na ibilang na special non-working holiday ang anibersaryo ng Iglesia ni Cristo (INC).

Batay sa House Bill 5686, tuwing anibersaryo ng Iglesia Ni Cristo na July 27 ay idedeklara itong non-working holiday.

Ang pagpapasa sa panukala ay isinagawa kaalinsabay ng ika-103 taong anibersaryo ng INC na inaprubahan ng may 242 kongresista.

Ang panukalang ito ay pinagsama-samang panukala nina Reps. Winston Castelo (PDP-Laban, Quezon City); Alfred Vargas (PDP-Laban, QC); Eugene de Vera (ABS Partylist); Gil P. Acosta (NP, Palawan); Gus Tambunting (PDP-Laban, Parañaque City) at Romeo Acop (LP, Antipolo City).

Sinabi ni Castelo na inaamyendahan ng HB 5686 ang Republic Act No. 9645 o mas kilala bilang Commemoration of the Founding Anniversary of Iglesia Ni Cristo Act, sa pamamagitan ng pagdedeklara ng July 27 bilang non-working holiday.

Paliwanag ni Castelo, chairman ng House Committee on Metro Manila Development, ito’y upang mabigyan ng pagkakataon ang mga Pilipino na miembro ng INC na maipagdiwang ang anibersaryo tuwing July 27.

Samantala, naipasa na sa Committee on Rules ang House Resolution 1163 na nagpapahatid ng pagbati sa ika-103 anibersaryo ng Iglesia Ni Cristo nitong nagdaang July 27, 2017 at ang House Resolution 1167 na nagpapahatid naman ng pagbati sa walong taong matagumpay na pangunguna ni Iglesia Ni Cristo Executive Minister Eduardo V. Manalo.

The phrase can and SHOULD only be used for the flexible portions of the economic provisions (i.e. nationality requirements).and not for the permanently protected provisions (i.e. national parks and timber lands) 

Congress removed Sec. 7 of RBH2 which allows foreign ownership of land. If it adheres to J. Azcuna's admonition, we can minimize Congress' discretion. Ideally, the provisions should state that Congress can determine the nationality requirements for each industry.

In her opening remarks, Robes said achieving the goal of immunizing Filipinos against the COVID-19 disease to definite courses of government action has become more imperative not only for the country to recover from the economic slump but to save lives as well. She stressed the importance of people’s participation in the COVID-19 vaccination program. “Dahil ang people’s participation ay naguugnay sa lahat ng klase ng tao, mayaman man o mahirap, at higit sa lahat, ang civil society o ang nasa gobyerno,” she said.
